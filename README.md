# magical-characters

## What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?

#### So far, you've built a themed and interactive web interface that fetches Harry Potter character data from an API, displays it with styled cards, and allows filtering by house—all while applying custom fonts, colors, and hover effects to create a magical look and feel. You’ve learned how responsive design requires flexible layouts using tools like Flexbox and media queries, and how JavaScript enables dynamic content and interactivity through event listeners and data fetching. This project has shown the importance of organizing code for reusability, handling API errors gracefully, and thinking about user experience across devices. A natural next step could be improving mobile responsiveness, adding loading indicators, or deploying the project online to share your work.


## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?


#### It took me around 1-2 day to complete the assignment, including designing the layout, writing the HTML/CSS/JavaScript, connecting to the API, and testing on different screen sizes. I initially expected it to take about 1-2 day, but I spent extra time refining the styling, debugging some API issues, and making the layout more responsive and polished. The additional time helped me better understand responsive design, API integration, and real-world problem-solving.
